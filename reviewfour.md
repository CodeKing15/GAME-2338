I give this game a 3.8 out of a 5.0

## Summary

Vector is one of those parkour mobile games that everyone loved to play, and for an eight-year-old game it was ahead of its time. As a mobile game it really outdid itself with the parkour animations and overall graphics. After playing many mobile games back in the day vector really stood out to me as one of those games that thought outside the box. The parkour animations heavily varied yet a simple swipe on the screen can perform them all. While the graphics where great and the animations where seamless, vector lacked in game length and needed more of a narrative.

Regardless of the games length it had a decent lore and top notch mechanics to make up for it. Similar to other platform games vector provided lots of running and jumping in a common fashion. The campaign length was a little short and, in some cases, cut off at the end. Upon finishing the game and not knowing if a sequel was underway it left me wanting more. Vector was simple yet frustrating game in a good way, and like many platform games the frustration became addicting. 

While the game was frustrating and you did die a lot, it was very liberating to finish each level after dozens if not hundreds of attempts. Always wanting to get 100% on a level to unlock a new parkour move for future levels required an extreme level of patience. Each parkour was different, one allowed you to climb up walls faster, vault more efficiently or even a little run boost from time to time. With all these parkour moves the game didnâ€™t offer many things in terms of enemies or obstacles. While you always had guys trying to catch you but always remained off screen, vector definitely needed more diverse obstacles in the game.
Final Thoughts

## Final Thoughts

At the end of the day vector was a game you wanted to play to kill time but always ended up taking all day to beat a level.
