### Rating

I give this game a 4.8 out of a 5.0

## Summary

Shadow Tactics is everything a game should be in its respective genre. Its lack of flaws of any kind is what makes this game a masterpiece. I have played a few RTS cartoon games, as well as a few top down, but Shadow Tactics has everything going for it such as perfect level design campaign length and character progression. The limited amount of playable characters allowed for very diverse gameplay depending on who you had for each mission. The one and only downside about the game is the amount of patience you might need to pass each level. With zero bugs, beautifully designed levels and well executed animation Shadow Tactics is a rare breed of a perfect game.

The strategic mechanics wasn’t especially new but depending on how the player approached the level the amount of tactics was endless. Such as a level with only three out of the five characters where available, I would need to figure out a very different strategy than if I had all five of them together for a level. The pacing of the campaign tactically throws players in the game’s mechanics. In the beginning you only have one playable character then the game creatively gives us more to play from as the first mission progress. With each new character you had at least 50 new strategies you could possibly do. While the characters where essential to the game they each had their own story that brought me to feel part of their mission.

While the character depth and design were great that was only part of what made Shadow Tactics a great game. The overall art and detail the developers put into the game is only something the gaming industry recently consistently started doing, and more games need to follow in the footsteps of Shadow tactics. The thing that interested me the most about the game was how players were allowed to use almost everything in the environment to further develop already existing strategies. I only wish the game allowed for moding which would allow for more missions, levels and even new characters.
Final Thoughts

## Final Thoughts

Shadow Tactics is not for everyone and is not the best game out there, but it is the best in its genre.
