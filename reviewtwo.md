I give this game a 3.0 out of a 5.0

## Summary

Company of Heroes 2 is one of those games you love to hate, so much untapped potential. Its strength lies in its level design and tactical mechanics. I have played many RTS games, as well as a few top down, but COH2 perfectly combines RTS, top down and level design all into one game. The units are well balanced, and diversity varies from nation to nation. While the game possessed diverse units and level design, each playable nation didn’t have a large array of units to choose from. With the lack of units and in some cases nations, the game felt redundant after a few skirmishes.

Despite the lack of playable content, the games deep strategic mechanics was a surprise to say the least. Like any RTS game, you need to capture several flags to earn points, accumulate resources and unlock more advance units. The smooth pace of the campaign masterfully introduces players to the game’s mechanics. After beating the campaign, multiplayer matches emerge as a strength for COH2. Multiplayer matches force action, preventing campers from hiding in little crevices feasting on brain dead bots. While the mechanics allow for large scale warfare, the game leans towards smaller and quicker pace skirmishes especially against players.

While the pace of the game draws one in, COH2 doesn’t tell the player which strategies are best suited for different situations. The lack of units and nations relied on the moding community to fill in gaps throughout the game; a lot more than it should have. Although the campaign teaches the very basics of the game, I wish it showed unique strategies instead of leaving the player to hopefully figure it out down the road. Even though COH2 needed the moding community to keep it alive, I think it was for the betterment of the game. A rich flavor and depth were added to it, something the developers seemed to have left out. 
Final Thoughts

## Final Thoughts

Overall the game is great as a RTS, just not enough packed in to push the needle. Although well designed levels allowed for many strategic implementations, COH2 ultimately falls short of its own lofty goals. If a more polished product had been delivered, maybe the moding community could have developed more if its strengths, rather than franticly keep the game afloat. For something that is just good enough, but not quite good enough; three stars seems to be the ultimate sweet spot.
