## Summary

Ark: Survival Evolved is one of those games with so much untapped potential. It really shines with its depth and diversity within the game. Ark was one of the first party-based games I have ever played, and it is always fun to play with friends. The dinosaur mounts and pets are very diverse, in what roles each thing can do and the amount of kinds of dinosaurs that are in the game. While the game did offer plenty of dinosaurs to play with, they were often times buggy. Adding more buggy dinosaurs into the game felt like the developer’s way of “fixing” the other dinosaurs, by sweeping them under the rug.

Looking past the buggy dinosaurs, Ark did however provide a very robust building system in the game. Similar to most games of the genre you need to survive in the wilderness build bases tame dinosaurs and rule the map or server. The campaign felt like a bunch of random missions put together and very unrelated to each other from map to map. Upon completing your first solo play through, Ark offers endless servers that have “clusters” of maps put together for an expansive multiplayer experience. The multiplayer can be really unbalanced, and players tend to build or attack bases under the map, which in most cases is exploiting. While the game is very deep in every aspect it does leave a trail of bugs and broken mechanics with each new update.

While the game is very fun to play with friends it can be very slow and boring by yourself. Ark is pretty good with all the vanilla features, but as a game on steam the moding community always adds that extra piece of content that you didn’t know the game needed. The moding community does play a major role in ark today, the game itself feels like a thing of the past that leaves one wanting bigger things out of Ark. Even though ark has died out, the genre lacks smooth gameplay as a whole and feels restrictive in its ability to explore more mechanics for each game.
## Final Thoughts

Overall Ark is fun to play with friends and is not recommended for solo players. Although Ark keeps getting expansions every few months and has plenty of updates to make it feel more alive. If the developers just stopped and actually tried to fix the game instead of adding new things, Ark would be a very solid game and may even come back to life. Until then it is just another party based game that’s only alive as long as the whole party wants to play again and again.
