I give this game a 4.0 out of a 5.0

## Summary

Tecmo Super Bowl is a football game from the early 90s known for its arcade style of play. From a graphics standpoint the game matches other games of its era, such as Final Fantasy. Being that  it was on the NES and meant for mass consumption, the color palate leaves a lot to be desired. Touchdown celebrations and the field of play have simple color schemes that become redundant. Choosing plays also paints the canvas with and abundance of green. The colors are bright enough to let the player get a feel for each teams identity. 

Tecmo Bowl shines most with gameplay. Although simplistic compared to today’s standards, its arcade feel creates a fun competitive environment. Within a few minutes its relatively easy to pick up on which plays give the player the most bang for their buck. Adding to the intrigue is the ease of avoiding defenders while on offense. Running in a straight-line decrease’s one’s chance of scoring, as silly as it sounds, running up and down the width of the field makes it challenging to get tackled. I’m sure every high school physics teacher is shaking their heads over action physics of runs and passes. Passes lend themselves to long Hail Mary type passes. An all-go down the sideline has a lot more success than one would think.

What Tecmo Bowl is best know for is probably the ability to use the unstoppable Bo Jackson. Few characters  are better known for game dominance than he is. His ability to run through, around and away from defenders made choosing his team the Raiders a moral imperative. He could single handedly beat an entire defense, making more of a defense versus Bo. In the years to follow players such as Barry Sanders, Jerry Rice and Randall Cunningham were added to the borderline unstoppable category, greatly increasing the fun factor of the game.

## Final Thoughts

I give Tecmo Bowl a 4 out of 5 because the fun factor. Watching a simple game turn into a highly competitive environment is quite invigorating. Its simplicity allows anyone who wants to play a small learning curve. Arguments over the use of Bo make for lively pre- and post-game discussions. Some games are meant to be simple, fast and fun; Tecmo Super Bowl meets those expectations for pleasant playing experience.
